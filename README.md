# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment analysis is a type of data mining that measures the inclination of peopleâ€™s opinions through natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics and text analysis, which are used to extract and analyse subjective information from the Web - mostly social media and similar sources. The analysed data quantifies the general public's sentiments or reactions toward certain products, people or ideas and reveal the contextual polarity of the information. Sentiment analysis is also known as opinion mining.
Types of Sentiment Analysis:
There are many types and flavours of sentiment analysis and sentiment analysis tools range from systems that focus on polarity (positive, negative, neutral) to systems that detect feelings and emotions (angry, happy, sad, etc) or identify intentions (e.g. interested v. not interested).
